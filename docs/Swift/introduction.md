# Introduction to Swift

Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.

## Basic Syntax

Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in Swift:

```swift
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Variables and Constants

Swift uses `var` for variables and `let` for constants.

```swift
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50

let myConstant = 3.14159
```

### Data Types

```swift
let anInteger: Int = 1
let aDouble: Double = 3.14
let aString: String = "Hello"
let aBool: Bool = true
```

### Control Flow

```swift
// If statement
let number = 10
if number > 5 {
    print("Number is greater than 5.")
}

// For-in loop
let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
for name in names {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
```
